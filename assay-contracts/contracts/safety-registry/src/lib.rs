#![no_std]
//! Assay safety registry: an on-chain gate for Stellar asset trap mechanics.
//!
//! # What this contract is, and what it is not
//!
//! A Soroban contract cannot call Horizon, fetch a stellar.toml, or read an
//! issuer's authorization flags from within a transaction. So this contract
//! does not scan anything. It stores *attestations* produced by an off-chain
//! Assay scanner and lets another contract read one atomically, in the same
//! transaction as the action it is protecting.
//!
//! That distinction is deliberate and is stated here rather than hidden behind
//! a reassuring function name. A caller is trusting the attester, plus the
//! `evidence_hash` that lets anyone verify the attestation against the evidence
//! the scanner actually fetched.
//!
//! # Why severity is safe to gate on
//!
//! [`Safety::severity`] is capability-only: it is derived from the issuer's
//! authorization flags and never adjusted by reputation, attribution, age, or
//! popularity. Two assets whose issuers hold identical power over holders get
//! identical severity. A gate reading `severity <= MEDIUM` is therefore relying
//! on a statement about ledger mechanics, not on anyone's opinion of an issuer.
//!
//! The one exception moves in the safe direction only: a confirmed malicious
//! listing escalates severity to [`SEVERITY_CRITICAL`]. Reputation can raise a
//! level, never lower one.
