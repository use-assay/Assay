# The Assay merge gate.
#
# Fails when a pull request touches a maintainer-owned safety-critical path or
# a dependency file, so branch protection can hold the PR for review instead of
# letting CI green-tick it through. A PR touching only other docs or tests
# passes; the eval tests and fixtures are owned because they pin judgment.
#
# This is a script rather than inline CI YAML so it can be verified offline
# against real commit ranges before it is trusted against a real PR:
#
#   scripts/merge-gate.sh BASE HEAD        # e.g. scripts/merge-gate.sh origin/main HEAD
#
# Exit codes: 0 the gate passes; 1 a maintainer-owned path or dependency file
# changed; 2 usage/argument error.

# Maintainer-owned paths. Changing any of these changes what an on-chain gate

# than auto-merged. Each entry says why it is owned.

# A directory entry covers everything beneath it. The list was audited on
# 2026-09-17 by committing a probe change to each path and running this script:
# the severity code, the aggregation, the scanner's error handling, this script
# and the CI workflow all passed unreviewed before they were added here, and an
# entry for internal/mechanics/eval.go named a file that does not exist.
