# Deployment

The Assay safety registry is deployed on **Stellar testnet**. It is not on
pubnet, and nothing here should be read as a claim that it is ready to be.

The last row is a mistake, recorded rather than hidden. Two working sessions
redeployed the same fixed wasm six minutes apart, so a second instance exists at
`CCMA2SW23WUWTJGSC2MTUZVYWROMVTT42NLPTBCOAHGM632KEMNL5N3G`, bound to the same
registry and running the same wasm (`ca40172e…`; it reused the upload above).
Soroban contracts cannot be deleted. It behaves identically and nothing refers
to it; `CAL5VYSW…` is the canonical instance.

Any of these can be read at
`https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/<hash>`.

### Example gate instances

Three instances exist on testnet and none can be removed. Only one should be
used. Checked on 2026-09-17 by fetching each contract's wasm and hashing it, and
by reading the constructor argument from each deploy transaction:

| Instance | Status | Wasm | Registry at construction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CAL5VYSWLKG367D5IYGI57XH7EMN5PLJ4CD6K3MO2HJBYYKEKPG3NKRX` | **canonical** — use this | `ca40172e…` (severity ceiling) | `CBK4FBIH…` |
| `CCMA2SW23WUWTJGSC2MTUZVYWROMVTT42NLPTBCOAHGM632KEMNL5N3G` | duplicate, **unused** — nothing in the repo refers to it | `ca40172e…` (identical) | `CBK4FBIH…` |
| `CANO57JRGTATHGLM26TWYPIXERSPVI5R52H33K7ZUJGGOEOVVZA44W3U` | **superseded, do not use** — admits critical-by-reputation assets ([#26](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/26)) | `d1683a1e…` (capability mask only) | `CBK4FBIH…` |

## Attested assets

Ten mainnet assets, spanning the severity range. Every number below was
produced by `assay attestation` from a live scan and submitted unmodified by
`make attest`; none was typed by hand. The full scan record, including the
eight further assets scanned but not attested, is in
[attestation-run.md](attestation-run.md).

`USDZ` is the case the [severity model](severity-model.md) exists to handle: a
confiscation-capable issuer with a *verified* domain. It scores `high` on
capability anyway, because a verified domain does not weaken clawback — it only
names who holds it. `BERKSHIRE` is the escalation case: capability alone puts it
at `high`, and StellarExpert's blocklisting of `nasdaq.finance` raises it to
`critical`. Reputation moved it up; nothing in the pipeline can move an asset
down.

`DOGE` is the same escalation shown at its extreme, and is the more instructive
of the two: base severity `0`, final severity `4`. Its issuer holds no
authorization flags at all, so capability analysis honestly returns `clear` for
an asset the curated directory tags `malicious`. Everything separating it from
a harmless asset lives on the reputation axis.

### The assets are mainnet; the attestations are testnet

These assets live on pubnet. Their **testnet** SAC addresses are what the
registry is keyed on here, because a contract ID is derived from the network
passphrase and so differs per network. Scanning reads pubnet, where the assets
actually are; attesting writes to testnet, where the contract actually is. A
pubnet deployment would key the same assets under their pubnet SAC addresses.

## Reproducing the round trip

Scanner output and on-chain state, read back after the fact:

```
$ ./assay attestation -raw USDZ-GAKTLPC4ZV37SSCITQ5IS5AQ4WPF4CF4VZJQPPAROSGXMYOATF5U6XPR
3	6	ca9b13a66f3a0a4b43d66dea29a505658447e08eee200d2bdb5e66aa1065fb4d

$ make read ASSET=USDZ-GAKTLPC4ZV37SSCITQ5IS5AQ4WPF4CF4VZJQPPAROSGXMYOATF5U6XPR
{"attested_at":1786771651,"evidence_hash":"ca9b13a66f3a0a4b43d66dea29a505658447e08eee200d2bdb5e66aa1065fb4d","flags":6,"severity":3}
```

The severity, the bitset, and the evidence hash match, and the hash was
recomputed from a *fresh* scan after the write — which is the point of leaving
retrieval timestamps out of the preimage. A verifier who re-scans an asset whose
sources have not changed reproduces the on-chain hash exactly. If it does not
reproduce, either the asset changed or the attestation is not what it claims.

`attested_at` is the ledger timestamp of the write: `1786771651` is
2026-08-15T05:27:31Z.

## Fail-closed, verified live

Checked against the deployed contract before any attestation existed
(2026-08-15), again that day afterwards, and again on 2026-09-17, using `native` XLM as a control asset that is deliberately never
attested (SAC `CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`):

| Call | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `get_safety(unattested)` | `null` |
| `is_safe(unattested, max_severity=4, max_age_secs=0)` | `false` |
| `is_safe(unattested, max_severity=0, max_age_secs=0)` | `false` |

The middle row is the one that matters: severity 4 is the maximum and age 0
disables the freshness check, so those are the most permissive arguments the
gate accepts. It still returns `false`, because there is nothing to admit. An
unknown asset is unknown, not safe.

`is_safe` across the attested set, read live (2026-08-15; re-read 2026-09-17 with
identical results — `max_age_secs=0` disables freshness, so these do not expire):

| Asset | `max_severity=0` | `max_severity=2` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AQUA` (0) | `true` | `true` |
| `USDC` (2) | `false` | `true` |
| `USDZ` (3) | `false` | `false` |
| `BERKSHIRE` (4) | `false` | `false` |
| unattested | `false` | `false` |

And through the deployed example gate, which is a real cross-contract call
rather than a direct read. The gate was redeployed on 2026-09-16 with the
severity ceiling that [#26](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/26)
tracked (deploy tx `21376057…7bfa4`); the results below are against the new
instance. Assets whose attestations are older than the gate's 24-hour window
are refused as stale, which exercises that branch live as well:

| Asset | `would_admit` | `deposit` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KALE` (clear, attested 2026-09-16) | `true` | succeeded, balance credited (`e3d2825c8e5a6615236904643873f0f325329c8a112ae338272a34abeab2f592`) |
| `AQUA` (clear, re-attested 2026-09-16) | `true` | succeeded, balance credited (`2cb3ce286c6f0874af9e8c86948c2cafad5ef4ef64edf055997595266d3da33f`) |
| `REPO` (critical, attested 2026-09-16) | `false` | `Error(Contract, #4)` — `SeverityTooHigh` |
| `DOGE` (critical by reputation, re-attested 2026-09-16) | `false` | `Error(Contract, #4)` — `SeverityTooHigh` |
| `USDZ` (clawback, attested 2026-08-15) | `false` | `Error(Contract, #2)` — `AttestationStale` |
| unattested (`native`) | `false` | `Error(Contract, #1)` — `NotAttested` |

Refusals fail at simulation, so no transaction is submitted for them; the admit
path is proven with submitted deposits whose balances read back. Every row
depends on the gate's 24-hour freshness window, so these results were observed
on 2026-09-16 and will not reproduce unchanged a day later without
re-attestation.

### The #26 fix, before and after

The first run of this table found `DOGE` and `AQUA` refused as stale
(`#2`), because their attestations predated the freshness window — which
refused `DOGE` for the wrong reason and left the fix itself unobserved on the
asset that exposed the bug. So both were re-attested from live scans, and the old
and new instances were queried against the same fresh attestations:

| Re-attestation | Transaction | `attested_at` | `evidence_hash` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DOGE` | `5012431be06a49f0bdc9b77e274aafaafabc6b30f6a5de535616050617ccd64c` | `1789546342` | `396c9f7c…91647e` (unchanged) |
| `AQUA` | `595f89b53c897f583132e302ea6f78f1c334ce819423a27c5dd7981174fe39e7` | `1789546357` | `688453bd…61a4a9` (unchanged) |

Both hashes are byte-identical to the original attestations, so the refresh
changed only `attested_at` — the reproducibility property holding over a month
for `AQUA`.

| Gate | `AQUA` | `DOGE` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old, `CANO57JR…` (capability mask only) | admitted | **admitted** — the bug |
| Fixed, `CAL5VYSW…` (mask + severity ceiling) | admitted | **refused, `#4` `SeverityTooHigh`** |

The old instance admitted `DOGE` because it masked capability bits only, and
DOGE's severity `4` comes entirely from reputation, which sets no capability bit.
The old instance is still deployed — contracts cannot be removed — and nothing in
these docs points to it any more.

## Redeploying

```sh
make build-contract          # stellar contract build -> assay-contracts/out/
make deploy-testnet          # upload + deploy, prints the new contract ID
stellar contract invoke --id <NEW_ID> --source-account assay-attester \
  --network testnet -- init --admin $(stellar keys address assay-attester)
```

Then update `CONTRACT_ID` in the [Makefile](../Makefile) and the addresses in
this file. `init` is single-shot; a second call fails with
`AlreadyInitialized`.

Attesting and reading, once deployed:

```sh
make attest ASSET=AQUA-GBNZILSTVQZ4R7IKQDGHYGY2QXL5QOFJYQMXPKWRRM5PAV7Y4M67AQUA
make read   ASSET=AQUA-GBNZILSTVQZ4R7IKQDGHYGY2QXL5QOFJYQMXPKWRRM5PAV7Y4M67AQUA
```

`make attest` scans the asset live, derives the arguments with
`assay attestation`, and submits them. There is no path through it that lets a
hand-written severity reach the contract.

## What this deployment is not

- **Not mainnet, and not a candidate for it.** The list below is why.
- **One key can write anything.** The admin is a single ed25519 account whose
  seed lives on one machine. Anyone holding it can attest any severity for any
  asset. A real deployment wants a threshold of independent attesters.
- **10 attested assets.** Everything else on the network reads as `None`. That is the
  correct answer — unknown, not safe — but it means the registry is not useful
  as a general lookup yet.
- **No re-attestation schedule.** These attestations are as fresh as the
  `attested_at` in the table and nothing is refreshing them. A caller must pass
  a `max_age_secs` it is actually willing to accept rather than trusting that
  someone is keeping the registry current. [freshness.md](freshness.md) has
  the measured flag-change rates behind that advice.
- **Testnet data is not durable.** Testnet is periodically reset, and Soroban
  persistent entries expire if their TTL is not extended. Both will take these
  attestations away without warning.
