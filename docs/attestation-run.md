# Attestation run

Every asset Assay has attested on-chain, what each check returned, and what the
run exposed about the scanner itself.

This document exists to be checked rather than believed. Every figure below came
from a live command or an on-chain record, and each section says which command
produces it. Nothing here is reconstructed from an earlier write-up.

- **Registry** `CBK4FBIHMDTXCUPE4E3ZDVSFJSCY5FJETTKNIQPN4LFJIKKIBLKIXQ73` (testnet)
- **Example gate** `CANO57JRGTATHGLM26TWYPIXERSPVI5R52H33K7ZUJGGOEOVVZA44W3U` (testnet)
- **First tranche attested** 2026-08-15 · **re-verified** 2026-09-05
- **Second tranche** 2026-09-05

To reproduce any row:

```sh
./assay scan CODE-ISSUER              # the findings and reasoning
./assay attestation -raw CODE-ISSUER  # severity, flags, evidence_hash
./assay attestation -preimage CODE-ISSUER   # the exact bytes hashed
make read ASSET=CODE-ISSUER           # what the contract actually stores
```

## Sample so far

**13 assets scanned, 7 attested on-chain.** The target is 15–20, reached across
several sittings rather than in one sweep; this document grows as each tranche
completes.

The first four were attested 2026-08-15. The rest were added 2026-09-05, chosen
deliberately to include assets expected to come back **clean** — a scanner
measured only on assets with problems is uncalibrated, and the original four
were three-quarters bad news.

| Asset | Severity | Base | Escalated | Accountability | Flags | On-chain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AQUA` | 0 clear | 0 | no | verified | `0` | yes |
| `ARST` | 0 clear | 0 | no | verified | `0` | yes |
| `yXLM` | 0 clear | 0 | no | verified | `0` | no |
| `XRP` | 0 clear | 0 | no | verified | `0` | no |
| `SSLX` | 0 clear | 0 | no | verified | `0` | no |
| `SHX` | 0 clear | 0 | no | verified | `8` | no |
| `USDC` | 2 medium | 2 | no | unverified | `18` | yes |
| `EURC` | 2 medium | 2 | no | unverified | `18` | no |
| `USDZ` | 3 high | 3 | no | verified | `6` | yes |
| `ZARZ` | 3 high | 3 | no | verified | `6` | no |
| `USDGLO` | 3 high | 3 | no | verified | `6` | yes |
| `BERKSHIRE` | 4 critical | 3 | **yes** | unverified | `54` | yes |
| `DOGE` | 4 critical | **0** | **yes** | unverified | `48` | yes |

Not every scan is attested. Each attestation is a real transaction, and the
value of this document is the scan record; the on-chain subset is chosen to
cover the range rather than to inflate a count.

**Calibration.** Of the 49 issued assets in StellarExpert's top 50 by rating,
**39 carry no authorization flags at all**, three carry only `auth_immutable`,
and seven carry some power. So `clear` is the overwhelmingly common answer on
the network, and a sample that did not reflect that would be measuring the
wrong thing.

`DOGE` is the most informative row in the table: base severity `0`, final
severity `4`. Capability analysis honestly returns `clear` for a known scam,
because its issuer genuinely holds no power over a holder's balance. It is
critical solely because a curated source says so. That asset is why reputation
exists as a separate upward-only axis — and it is also what broke two things
this run found.

## AQUA — clear

`AQUA-GBNZILSTVQZ4R7IKQDGHYGY2QXL5QOFJYQMXPKWRRM5PAV7Y4M67AQUA`
Scanned 2026-09-05T06:55:53Z · attested 2026-08-15T05:26:51Z

**`capability` → clear, mechanics none.** Horizon reports
`auth_required=false auth_revocable=false auth_immutable=false auth_clawback_enabled=false`.
The issuer holds no authorization flags: it cannot freeze, confiscate, or gate
this asset. The reasoning also states the converse, which matters — the flags
are *not* locked (`auth_immutable` unset), so the issuer may add freeze or
confiscation powers later. Under CAP-0035 that would not reach existing
trustlines but would apply to any opened after the change.

**`sep1-domain` → accountability verified.** `home_domain` is `aqua.network`,
and that domain's `stellar.toml` `CURRENCIES` lists this exact code and issuer.
Reciprocal, so a named party has publicly claimed the asset. It contributes
nothing to severity.

**`reputation` → no escalation.** The directory lists the issuer as
`"AQUA Issuer"` (domain `aqua.network`, tags `anchor, issuer`); blocked-domains
returns `blocked=false`. Neither lowers the capability severity.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| On-chain | `severity 0`, `flags 0`, `attested_at 1786771611` |
| `evidence_hash` | `688453bd22e9b694b9c70659d37526bdae18944645542642008e9d961461a4a9` |

## USDC — medium

`USDC-GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN`
Scanned 2026-09-05T06:55:58Z · attested 2026-08-15T05:27:11Z

**`capability` → medium, mechanics `auth_revocable`.** The issuer can freeze a
holder's balance so it cannot be moved. It **cannot** claw back —
`auth_clawback_enabled=false`, verified live. Worth stating plainly because the
widespread assumption that regulated stablecoins carry clawback is false for the
largest asset on the network.

**`sep1-domain` → accountability unverified, mechanic `domain_unverified`.**
`home_domain` is `circle.com`, and `https://circle.com/.well-known/stellar.toml`
returns **404**. So the most reputable regulated stablecoin on Stellar fails
reciprocal SEP-1 verification by the letter of the spec.

This is the case that justifies keeping accountability out of severity. Had
attribution been a discount, USDC would score worse than a scam asset with a
working `stellar.toml`. It is reported as it is, not special-cased.

Note also that the directory names the issuer `"Centre"` on domain `centre.io`,
which does not match the advertised `circle.com`. Assay does not currently
compare those two — see [tracked as #4](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/4).

**`reputation` → no escalation.** Directory: `"Centre"` (tags `anchor, issuer`).
Blocked-domains: `circle.com` `blocked=false`.

## USDZ — high, and the reason severity is capability-only

`USDZ-GAKTLPC4ZV37SSCITQ5IS5AQ4WPF4CF4VZJQPPAROSGXMYOATF5U6XPR`
Scanned 2026-09-05T06:56:02Z · attested 2026-08-15T05:27:31Z

**`capability` → high, mechanics `auth_revocable | auth_clawback_enabled`.** The
issuer can freeze a balance and can confiscate it outright and burn it, without
the holder's signature. Clawback already applies to trustlines opened now.

**`sep1-domain` → accountability verified.** `home_domain` is `zeam.money` and
that domain's `stellar.toml` claims this exact code and issuer.

**This is the case the severity model exists for.** USDZ is domain-verified,
unblocklisted, and scores `high` anyway — because a verified domain does not
weaken clawback. It only names who holds it. Accountability is reported beside
severity and never folded into it.

**`reputation` → no escalation.** Directory: `"Zeam.Money"` (domain
`zeam.money`, tags `issuer`). Blocked-domains: `blocked=false`.

A caution, because it would be easy to over-read this asset: a directory tag of
`issuer` and a working `stellar.toml` establish that *someone published a claim*,
not that the entity behind it is what it appears to be. Assay has not
independently verified who operates `zeam.money`, and nothing in this document
should be read as saying it has.

## BERKSHIRE — critical by escalation

`BERKSHIRE-GA22QHSHQEHDJS2ZOINSC77XPPQ24G5EFRJGVEIZLKC5FAW3PQ5XNSDQ`
Scanned 2026-09-05T06:56:07Z · attested 2026-08-15T05:27:46Z

**`capability` → high, mechanics `auth_revocable | auth_clawback_enabled`.**
Identical capability to USDZ. On flags alone these two assets are the same
asset, which is the intended behaviour: capability is capability.

**`sep1-domain` → accountability unverified, mechanic `domain_unverified`.**
`home_domain` is `nasdaq.finance`; DNS does not resolve it.

**`reputation` → escalates to critical, mechanic `blocklisted`.** The curated
directory lists the issuer as `"Scam Asset"` with tags `malicious, unsafe`.
Reported as StellarExpert's determination, not re-derived by Assay, and it
raises the level regardless of the flags.

Base stays `3`; final severity is `4`; `escalated: true`. The two numbers are
stored separately precisely so this is auditable.

**A caveat this asset exposed.** `blocked-domains` returns
`"nasdaq.finance" blocked=false` — the malicious-domain blocklist does **not**
contain a domain whose issuer the directory tags `malicious`. The escalation
came entirely from the directory. Had Assay consulted only the blocklist,
a confirmed scam would not have escalated. Consumed sources are not
interchangeable and are not individually complete.

## The round trip still reproduces, three weeks on

Re-scanned 2026-09-05 against attestations written 2026-08-15. All four
severities, bitsets, and evidence hashes match what the contract stores:

| Asset | Re-scan `severity flags evidence_hash` | On-chain | Match |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AQUA` | `0 0 688453bd…61a4a9` | `0 0 688453bd…61a4a9` | yes |
| `USDC` | `2 18 e7fc765d…d790bd` | `2 18 e7fc765d…d790bd` | yes |
| `USDZ` | `3 6 ca9b13a6…65fb4d` | `3 6 ca9b13a6…65fb4d` | yes |
| `BERKSHIRE` | `4 54 dc2bbf08…171a0d` | `4 54 dc2bbf08…171a0d` | yes |

That is the property the encoding was designed for: retrieval timestamps are
outside the preimage, so unchanged evidence reproduces the same hash and a
verifier can re-scan rather than trust. One of the four reproduces for a
weaker reason than it appears — see [Finding 2](#finding-2).

## Fail-closed, demonstrated

Verified live on 2026-09-05 using `native` XLM as a control that is deliberately
never attested (`CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`).

| Attempted | Result | Why that is correct |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_safety(unattested)` | `null` | Never-attested stays distinguishable from an attestation of `clear`. Collapsing them would make every unscanned asset read as safe. |
| `is_safe(unattested, max_severity=4, max_age_secs=0)` | `false` | These are the **most permissive arguments the gate accepts** — the maximum severity, freshness check disabled. It still refuses, because there is nothing to admit. |
| gate `would_admit(unattested)` | `false` | Same answer through a real cross-contract call rather than a direct read. |
| gate `deposit(unattested)` **submitted** | reverts `Error(Contract, #1)` `NotAttested` | The refusal is a real transaction revert, not an advisory return value. |

The second row is the one that matters. An unknown asset is unknown, not safe,
and no argument the caller supplies converts one into the other.

## What the checks can get wrong

Stated per check, because a scanner that publishes only its successes is not
measurable.

### `capability`

- **Reads one source and does not corroborate it.** Severity comes from the
  `flags` object on Horizon's `/assets` record. The scan also fetches the issuer
  *account*, which carries its own copy of the same flags, and **never compares
  them**. Those are different ingestion paths; if they disagree, Assay silently
  uses one. A free consistency check is available and is not made.
- **Prospective only.** Clawback is inherited at trustline creation (CAP-0035),
  so a `high` verdict describes what happens to a trustline you open *now*, not
  a balance you already hold.
- **`clear` doubles as "not evaluated".** There is no severity value meaning
  unknown, so a report built from an empty subject would read `clear` — the
  safest value in the ABI. Unreachable through the live scanner, which fails
  hard when Horizon fails, but not prevented by construction.
- **No false positives observed in this run.** Flags are consensus-enforced
  booleans; the check reports them without interpretation. Its risk is
  under-reporting, not over-reporting.

### `sep1-domain`

- **`unverified` conflates two different facts.** "The `stellar.toml` could not
  be fetched" and "it was fetched and does not claim this asset" both produce
  `unverified`. The distinction survives only in the prose reasoning and the
  evidence claim — a consumer switching on the JSON `accountability` field
  cannot tell a broken web server from a refused claim. Both appear in this run:
  USDC is a 404, BERKSHIRE is a DNS failure.
- **Linked currency files are not followed.** A `stellar.toml` may point to a
  per-currency file rather than inline the entry. Assay reports that as
  unconfirmed rather than refuted — but the detection counts only entries with a
  `toml` link and *no* code or issuer. An entry carrying both a link and a code
  is missed, so the hedge is skipped in a case where it applies.
- **A verified domain is weak evidence.** It proves someone published a matching
  claim. Publishing a `stellar.toml` takes ten minutes.

### `reputation`

- **This check's failure mode is the subject of [Finding 1](#finding-1) below,
  and it is the most serious thing in this document.**
- **Escalation rests on a self-asserted string.** The blocklist is queried using
  the issuer's `home_domain` — the same free-text field this project elsewhere
  says proves nothing. An issuer that clears `home_domain` is never checked
  against the blocklist at all.
- **Only two directory tags are recognised** (`malicious`, `unsafe`). Any other
  adverse tag is silently ignored — a false negative that will never announce
  itself.
- **Consumed sources are not individually complete**, as BERKSHIRE showed:
  directory `malicious`, blocklist `blocked=false`.

## The second tranche, 2026-09-05

Nine assets added. All nine scans completed with every source answering — which
is now something the output states rather than something to be assumed.

| Asset | Issuer | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yXLM` | `GARDNV3Q…TEDL5T55` | clear, verified (`ultracapital.xyz`) |
| `XRP` | `GBXRPL45…PRDTD5` | clear, verified |
| `ARST` | `GCSAZVWX…DRGCI3DG` | clear, verified |
| `SSLX` | `GBHFGY3Z…REH37UR` | clear, verified |
| `SHX` | `GDSTRSHX…7I7KJ6JH` | clear + `auth_immutable`, verified (`stronghold.co`) |
| `EURC` | `GDHU6WRG…Y4ITNPP2` | medium, `circle.com` toml 404 |
| `ZARZ` | `GAROH4EV…MCTJBB3U` | high, clawback, verified (`zeam.money`) |
| `USDGLO` | `GBBS25EG…J34HWS6XV` | high, clawback, verified; issuer not in directory |
| `DOGE` | `GA22IDJN…AXCULNQ7P` | **critical by escalation, base clear** |

Three were attested on-chain:

| Asset | On-chain | `evidence_hash` | Attest tx |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DOGE` | `severity 4`, `flags 48`, `attested_at 1788592982` (2026-09-05T07:23:02Z) | `396c9f7c…91647e` | `ac1a89a64159e6ac2e9ed61bd67a79cd1584287cf57d19f9dc188d80e81298a6` |
| `ARST` | `severity 0`, `flags 0`, `attested_at 1788593012` (2026-09-05T07:23:32Z) | `82a6103f…fccacb` | `f497b91ab84340bcb7418940e620d080c8566e0cdf27346c8d74e165b5d66506` |
| `USDGLO` | `severity 3`, `flags 6`, `attested_at 1788593047` (2026-09-05T07:24:07Z) | `69b8c4f8…7c27a5` | `6016ed7d908cd20237f114b0cb6778886027ddc8336952acb77ddbeff16caf42` |

`SHX` is worth a note: `auth_immutable` is set, so it carries mechanic bit
`1 << 3` while staying severity `0`. That is deliberate — locking the flag set
is not a power over holders, and here it is protective, because the issuer can
now never add freeze or clawback. Bits in the report are not all bad news, and
a gate refusing on any non-zero bitset would refuse this asset for being
permanently safe.

`EURC` repeats the `USDC` result exactly: Circle's euro stablecoin also fails
reciprocal SEP-1 verification, because `circle.com/.well-known/stellar.toml`
returns 404 for both. Two independent assets, same issuer domain, same honest
`unverified`.

### The blocklist did not flag either confirmed scam

Both `BERKSHIRE` and `DOGE` are tagged `malicious, unsafe` in the curated
directory. Both had their `home_domain` checked against the malicious-domain
blocklist, and both came back `blocked=false`:

```
$ curl -s https://api.stellar.expert/explorer/directory/blocked-domains/darkpool.digital
{"domain":"darkpool.digital","blocked":false}
```

So the escalation came entirely from the directory, in both cases. Consulting
only the blocklist would have missed two out of two known scams in this sample.
That is not a criticism of StellarExpert — the two data sets answer different
questions — but it is a concrete reason Assay consumes both, and a caution
against treating any single curated source as complete.

## Findings from this run

### Finding 1 — a source outage is reported as a clean result {#finding-1}

`internal/stellarexpert/client.go` correctly separates outcomes: HTTP 404 means
genuinely not listed and returns no error; 429, 5xx, and timeouts return an
error. `internal/scan/scan.go` then discards that error:

```go
if blocked, err := s.Expert.BlockedDomain(ctx, domain); err == nil { sub.Blocked = blocked }
if entry, err := s.Expert.Directory(ctx, a.Issuer); err == nil { sub.Directory = entry }
```

Both outcomes leave the field `nil`, and `check_reputation.go` then reports:

> "No curated reputation data was available for this issuer. **That is the
> normal case** and is not a positive signal."

That sentence is true on a 404 and false on a rate-limit. The report cannot tell
them apart, and neither can anything downstream — no field on the report records
that a source was unreachable.

**Why it matters.** `BERKSHIRE` above reaches `critical` *only* through
reputation; its capability severity is `high`, and `DOGE-GA22IDJN…` — a known
scam in the eval set — is `clear` on capability and `critical` only by
escalation. During a StellarExpert outage that asset scans `clear`, and the
resulting report passes the attestation invariant and is writable on-chain as
clear.

It contradicts this project's own published rule in
[docs/checks.md](checks.md): *"'We could not check' and 'this is fine' are
different answers and must never render the same."* Ledger data fails closed —
Horizon errors abort the scan — while reputation fails open and silent. That
asymmetry was not documented anywhere.

Per [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md), a way to make Assay under-report risk
is a security issue rather than a bug.

**Status: fixed.** Tracked as
[#23](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/23).

An unreachable source is now recorded as attributed evidence carrying the
failure verbatim, the finding is marked `undetermined`, the report names the
check on `undetermined_checks`, and `attest.FromReport` refuses to write a
partial scan on-chain.

Demonstrated rather than asserted — the scanner pointed at a dead StellarExpert
endpoint, everything else live:

```
$ # DOGE-GA22IDJN…, StellarExpert pointed at 127.0.0.1:1
severity      clear
undetermined  true [reputation]
attestable?   attest: scan is undetermined, so there is nothing to attest: reputation could not complete
```

Before the fix, that same scan produced `severity: clear` with "that is the
normal case" and was writable on-chain. Severity is deliberately still `clear`:
capability was fully readable and is reported as measured. What changed is that
the report says so and the attestation is refused.

This run's four assets are unaffected — all three sources answered for all four,
evidenced by the four evidence entries each report carries, and all four
on-chain hashes still reproduce after the change. But that was luck rather than
design: nothing in the output would have told us otherwise, which is the
finding.

### Finding 2 — the evidence hash is not reproducible across machines {#finding-2}

`evidence_hash` is documented as verifiable by re-scanning and recomputing. That
holds only when the evidence text is machine-independent, and it is not.

When a `stellar.toml` fetch fails, the raw Go transport error is recorded
verbatim and hashed. BERKSHIRE's preimage — one of the four already on-chain —
contains:

```
evidence	stellar.toml	https://nasdaq.finance/.well-known/stellar.toml	not retrievable: sep1: fetch https://nasdaq.finance/.well-known/stellar.toml: Get "https://nasdaq.finance/.well-known/stellar.toml": dial tcp: lookup nasdaq.finance on 10.255.255.254:53: no such host
```

`10.255.255.254` is **this machine's DNS resolver**. The on-chain hash
`dc2bbf08…171a0d` therefore commits to a local network detail. It reproduces
above only because the re-scan ran on the same host; a verifier anywhere else
gets different bytes, a different hash, and would reasonably conclude the
attestation does not match its evidence when nothing is wrong.

The same class of text — timeouts carrying resolved IPs, `context deadline
exceeded` versus a connection reset — makes any asset with an unreachable domain
non-reproducible. USDC is unaffected: a clean `status 404` is stable.

**Status: not fixed, deliberately.** The fix is to normalise transport errors to
a stable form before they enter the preimage, which changes the preimage and so
requires an `assay-evidence-v2` version bump and re-attestation of BERKSHIRE.
That is a larger change than it looks and is not being rushed into the same
sitting that found it. Tracked as
[#24](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/24).

---

### Finding 3 — an unlisted address was reported as `listed as ""`

Surfaced by `USDGLO-GBBS25EG…`. StellarExpert's directory does not return 404
for an address it holds no entry for; it returns `200` with an empty object:

```
$ curl -s -w " [HTTP %{http_code}]" https://api.stellar.expert/explorer/directory/GBBS25EGYQPGEZCGCFBKG4OAGFXU6DSOQBGTHELLJT3HZXZJ34HWS6XV
{} [HTTP 200]
```

The client treated any `200` as a hit, so the reputation check published:

```
stellar.expert/directory: listed as "" (domain "", tags: )
```

A claim the directory never made, attributed to it by name and URL, and it
would have entered the `evidence_hash` preimage of any attestation built from
that scan.

Not a severity bug — an empty entry has no tags, so nothing escalated and no
risk was under-reported. The damage is to the evidence, which is the part a
reader is supposed to be able to check independently, and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)'s first rule is never to display a value
that was not fetched.

**Status: fixed.** Tracked as
[#25](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/25). Confirmed against three
unlisted addresses before encoding the behaviour. The four earlier attestations
still reproduce their hashes; none had an empty entry.

### Finding 4 — the example gate admits a critical asset

This is the one the widened sample was for, and it is on a deployed contract.

`DOGE` is attested `severity 4`, `flags 48`. The registry answers correctly:

```
registry is_safe(DOGE, max_severity=2, max_age_secs=0)  ->  false
gate     would_admit(DOGE)                              ->  true
```

The example gate masks capability bits only —
`REFUSED_MECHANICS = auth_revocable | auth_clawback_enabled = 6` — and `48 & 6`
is `0`. It never reads `severity` at all, so it admits an asset a curated source
calls malicious.

The cause is structural rather than a slip. Reputation escalation raises
`severity` and sets `blocklisted`; it does not set a capability bit, and it must
not, because capability bits describe what an issuer *can do* and a scam listing
is not a capability. A mask over capability bits therefore cannot see escalation
by construction — which makes "gate on the bitset", the advice
[integrating.md](integrating.md) previously led with, actively unsafe as a
general rule. The correct rule is **bitset _and_ severity**.

`DOGE` also shows why this went unnoticed: it is the only asset in the sample
whose base severity and final severity differ by the whole scale, `0` to `4`.
Every other asset here has capability bits that a mask would catch anyway, so
the mask looked sufficient right up until an asset arrived whose severity came
from somewhere the mask cannot see.

**Status: docs corrected, contract fix pending.** Tracked as
[#26](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/26). The guidance and code
sample in [integrating.md](integrating.md) now gate on both axes and carry the
`DOGE` counter-example; the deployed example contract still has the bug and the
document says so rather than quietly patching around it. Correcting the contract
means a rebuild and redeploy, which is its own change.

### The fix from Finding 1 caught a real outage during this run

Not a finding, but the reason to record it: while re-verifying hashes mid-sweep,
one `BERKSHIRE` scan came back

```
attest: scan is undetermined, so there is nothing to attest: reputation could not complete
```

A genuine transient StellarExpert failure, caught and refused, during exactly
the kind of rapid multi-asset sweep [#23](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/23)
predicted would trigger it. The next attempt succeeded and reproduced the
on-chain hash. Before the fix, that scan would have returned `severity 3`
instead of `4` — silently dropping the escalation — and been attestable.

## What this run does not establish

- **13 assets is not a measurement.** No precision or recall number is quoted,
  because 13 subjects cannot support one. The target is 15–20 and this document
  is not finished.
- **The sample is not random.** It was drawn from StellarExpert's top 50 by
  rating, plus two known scams carried over from the eval set. Highly-rated
  assets are not representative of the network: a random sample would be
  dominated by tiny, unlisted, recently-created assets, which is where a
  scanner's judgment is hardest and where this sample says nothing.
- **Nothing here measures false negatives.** Every asset in the table was
  classified from flags that are consensus-enforced facts, so the capability
  half is hard to get wrong. What is not measured is what Assay *fails to
  notice* — an abusive issuer with no flags and no curated listing is `clear`
  here and would be, correctly and uselessly, until someone reports it.
- **No independent verification of any issuer's identity.** A verified
  `stellar.toml` and a directory listing are claims by others, recorded as
  attributed evidence. Assay has not confirmed that any issuer here is the
  entity it appears to be. This matters most for the clawback-capable assets,
  where "legitimate regulated issuer" is the reading a reader will reach for and
  is precisely what has not been established — see
  [#16](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/16).
- **The eval set is unchanged at five subjects.** These scans are live and
  drift with the ledger; a fixture pins judgment. Attesting an asset is not
  labelling it.
- **Testnet.** One key can write any attestation; testnet resets and Soroban TTL
  expiry will remove these entries.
- **Attested 2026-08-15 and 2026-09-05.** Issuers can change flags at any time.
  These attestations are exactly as fresh as their `attested_at`, and nothing
  refreshes them on a schedule.
- **Four findings in 13 assets.** Two are fixed, one has its docs corrected and
  its code pending, one is deferred with a version bump behind it. That rate
  should be read as a statement about how much of this had been exercised
  before, not as a claim that the remainder is now sound.
