# The CLI

`assay` is one binary with four subcommands. All of them print human-readable
JSON by default; every subcommand that produces structured output also has a
`-raw` form that prints tab-separated values, for scripts and CI.

```
usage:
  assay scan CODE-ISSUER          classify one asset and print the report as JSON
  assay attestation CODE-ISSUER   print the on-chain attest() arguments for one asset
  assay history [-guarantee] [-raw] CODE-ISSUER
                                  print the asset's observation history
  assay serve [-addr] [-history PATH]
                                  serve the HTTP API and UI
```

## assay scan

Scans one asset and prints the full report: the findings, the reasoning behind
each, and the evidence every conclusion is attributed to.

```
./assay scan CODE-ISSUER              # the findings and reasoning
```

## assay attestation

Derives the arguments of an on-chain `attest()` call from a live scan. It
deliberately does not submit anything: signing belongs to whoever holds the
attester key, and keeping derivation separate from submission means the
numbers going on-chain can be inspected before a key ever touches them.

```
./assay attestation CODE-ISSUER       # severity, flags, evidence_hash
./assay attestation -preimage CODE-ISSUER   # + the bytes the hash commits to
./assay attestation -raw CODE-ISSUER  # just `SEVERITY<TAB>FLAGS<TAB>HASH`
```

## assay history

Prints an asset's observation history: one line per recorded observation, in
time order, derived from the report's evidence entries. Where `scan` answers
"what is true now", `history` answers "what did we observe, and when" — the
view an auditor needs when an asset's state changed and someone wants to know
whether it was ever different.

Each entry carries the asset, the report's severity at scan time, the
**transition** — what the issuer was observed doing, reduced to a term
(`malicious`, `listed as`, `blocked`, `unverified`, `not retrievable`, …) — the
observation's reason verbatim, and the time it was retrieved.

An observation that does not reduce to a known transition prints as
`unknown`. The history view deliberately does not re-derive the verdict; it
reports what each observation said.

```
./assay history CODE-ISSUER           # the observations as JSON
./assay history -raw CODE-ISSUER      # `ASSET<TAB>SEVERITY<TAB>TRANSITION<TAB>REASON`
```

Flags:

- `-raw` — print the history tab-separated instead of as JSON, for scripting.
- `-guarantee` — exit non-zero when the asset has no observations, so a script
  can distinguish "no history" from "history ran fine" without parsing output.

Semantics:

- **valid state** — the observations print in time order.
- **missing state** — a clear message (`no observations for ASSET`), and exit
  0 unless `-guarantee` was given.
- **unknown state** — an observation whose claim matches no known transition
  prints with transition `unknown` rather than being dropped.

## assay serve

Serves the HTTP API and UI. The API exposes the same reports the CLI prints;
see `docs/integrating.md` for what a consumer reads out of it, and
[history.md](history.md) for the observation history endpoint.

```
./assay serve -addr :8080
./assay serve -addr :8080 -history /var/lib/assay/history.jsonl
```

Each successful `GET /api/v1/scan` records an observation, and
`GET /api/v1/history?asset=CODE-ISSUER` returns them in time order with the
derived transitions. `-history` points that store at an append-only JSON Lines
log so it survives a restart; without it, history is in memory and lost when the
process exits. The default retention is 256 observations per asset and the
policy is in [history.md](history.md).
