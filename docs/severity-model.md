# The severity model

This is the part of Assay worth arguing about. Reading a flag is trivial and
deterministic. Deciding what a flag *means* is the whole product.

## The problem

`auth_clawback_enabled` lets an issuer confiscate your balance and burn it,
without your signature. It is also the mechanism a regulated issuer uses to meet
legal obligations — sanctions enforcement, court-ordered reversal, recovering
provably stolen funds. The flag is identical in both cases. The ledger cannot
tell you which one you are looking at, because the difference is not on the
ledger.

A scanner that paints every clawback-capable asset red is wrong about every
well-run regulated asset, and a tool that is wrong about the largest assets on
the network gets ignored. A scanner that waves through anything issued by a
recognizable name is worse: it has quietly become a brand-recognition service
wearing a security tool's clothes.

## The resolution: two axes, never merged

Assay reports **severity** and **accountability** as separate values, and
refuses to combine them into a single score.

| | Severity | Accountability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Question | What *can* the issuer do to my balance? | Who, if anyone, stands behind that power? |
| Source | Issuer authorization flags | Reciprocal SEP-1 domain, curated directory |
| Nature | Consensus-enforced fact | Published claim |
| Effect | Gates on-chain decisions | Informs a human |

The user decides what to do with the combination. Assay does not decide for
them by averaging a fact with an opinion.

## Rule 1: severity is capability-only

Severity is derived from issuer flags and nothing else. Not reputation, not age,
not trustline count, not who the issuer is.

**Two assets whose issuers hold identical power over holders receive identical
severity.** A household-name regulated stablecoin and an anonymous account
created an hour ago, with the same flags, classify the same.

This is not an oversight. It is the property that makes the on-chain gate sound.
A contract reading `severity <= MEDIUM` is relying on a statement about ledger
mechanics. The moment reputation could lower a severity, that contract would be
relying on a third party's opinion, delivered through a data feed, about an
issuer — and it would have no way to tell the two kinds of claim apart.

It also removes the attack. If attribution lowered severity, the cheapest way
past the gate would be to buy attribution: register a domain, publish a
stellar.toml, get listed. Capability-only severity makes that pointless, because
the flags are what is measured and the flags do not care who you are.

The tests enforce this directly: stripping every trace of attribution from a
subject must not change its severity.

## Rule 2: reputation is monotonic upward

A confirmed malicious listing escalates severity to **Critical**, regardless of
flags. Nothing ever lowers severity.

The asymmetry is deliberate, and it is the correct reading of what the evidence
supports:

- **Presence** on a curated malicious list is a positive observation. Someone
  investigated and concluded abuse. That is decisive.
- **Absence** is not an observation at all. Most legitimate assets are absent
  from scam lists. So is every scam nobody has reported yet. Treating absence as
  a safety signal would mean every brand-new trap scores well precisely when it
  is most dangerous.

Every escalation is auditable: the report carries `base_severity` (capability
alone) next to `severity` (after escalation) and a boolean `escalated`, so you
can always see exactly what reputation contributed.

## Rule 3: accountability is reported, never discounted

Reciprocal SEP-1 verification produces `verified`, `unverified`, or `unknown`.
It never moves severity.

Verifying who an issuer is does not reduce what they can do to your balance. It
tells you there is a named party to sue, complain about, or subpoena — which is
genuinely valuable, and is exactly why it gets its own field instead of being
dissolved into a number.

Live data makes the case better than argument does. Circle's USDC issuer
advertises `home_domain = circle.com`, and `circle.com/.well-known/stellar.toml`
returns **404**. By SEP-1's own definition, the single most reputable regulated
stablecoin on Stellar currently fails reciprocal domain verification. Had
accountability been wired into severity, USDC would have scored *worse* than a
scam asset that took ten minutes to publish a valid toml.

Assay reports this honestly — `accountability: unverified` — and does not
special-case it.

## Rule 4: do not double-count what the protocol requires

CAP-0035 makes `auth_revocable` a **precondition** for `auth_clawback_enabled`.
Setting clawback without revocable fails with
`SET_OPTIONS_AUTH_REVOCABLE_REQUIRED`, and revocable cannot be cleared while
clawback is set.

So "revocable AND clawback" is not a suspicious combination — it is the only
legal way to have clawback at all. Scoring the two as independent signals would
inflate every clawback asset for a reason the protocol mandates.

Severity is therefore the **highest single capability present**, not a sum.
Confirmed empirically: across 2,400 sampled live assets, exactly zero have
clawback without revocable.

## The levels

Each level is pinned to a specific capability, so the number is
self-documenting on-chain.

| | Level | Flag | What the issuer can do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `clear` | *(none)* | Nothing. No special power over holders. |
| 1 | `low` | `auth_required` | Decide who may open a trustline. Cannot touch existing holders. |
| 2 | `medium` | `auth_revocable` | Freeze an existing holder's balance in place. |
| 3 | `high` | `auth_clawback_enabled` | Confiscate and burn a balance, without the holder's signature. |
| 4 | `critical` | *(reputation)* | Reserved for escalation. Never produced by reading flags. |

`auth_immutable` is deliberately **not** a level. It is not a power over
holders; it fixes whether the power set can change. Which direction that cuts
depends entirely on what is already set:

- Locked with no dangerous flags — a genuine safety property. Clawback can never
  be added.
- Locked with clawback — permanent. The power can never be given up.

Assay states this in the reasoning rather than scoring it, because a single
number cannot carry a conditional.

## What severity does not tell you

**Whether the issuer will use the power.** Assay measures capability, not
intent. Nothing on the ledger reveals intent.

**Whether an existing holder is exposed.** Under CAP-0035 the trustline flag
`TRUSTLINE_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` is set *when the trustline is created*.
Enabling clawback later does not reach trustlines that already exist.

Assay reports risk for a **prospective** holder — "what happens if I open a
trustline now" — which is what current issuer flags answer exactly. It is not a
claim about anyone's existing position. Checking an existing trustline's own
flags is [a separate check that does not exist yet](checks.md).

**That a `clear` asset is safe.** It means the *issuer* has no special power.
The asset can still be worthless, a rug pull by another mechanism, or an
outright impersonation. `DOGE-GA22IDJN…` in the eval set carries no auth flags
at all and is a known scam.

Assay scans one specific attack surface. It says so rather than implying
coverage it does not have.
