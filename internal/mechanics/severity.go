// Severity is Assay's risk level for an asset.
//
// Severity is CAPABILITY-ONLY. It answers exactly one question: what is the
// issuer able to do to a holder's balance? It is derived from the issuer's
// authorization flags, which are consensus-enforced facts, and from nothing
// else.
//
// Reputation, attribution, age, popularity, and trustline count do not lower
// severity. Ever. Two assets with identical issuer capability return identical
// severity even if one is issued by a household-name regulated institution and
// the other by an anonymous account created an hour ago. This is not an
// oversight — it is the property that makes the on-chain gate sound. A gate
// that reads `severity <= Medium` must be relying on a statement about
// mechanics, not on a statement about anyone's opinion of the issuer.
//
// Reputation is monotonic upward only: confirmed-bad reputation escalates to
// Critical, because evidence of abuse is decisive. Absence of bad reputation is
// never evidence of good, so it moves nothing.
//
// Whether anyone stands behind the capability is reported separately, as
// Accountability. See docs/severity-model.md.
