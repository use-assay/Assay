// held. The two sources are separate ingestion paths, so a disagreement means
// one of them is wrong or stale, and there is no way to tell which from inside
// a single scan. Choosing the safer-looking copy would let indexer lag lower a
// severity, which is the one direction this project never resolves silently.
//
// auth_immutable is handled the other way, and deliberately. It is not a power
// over a holder: it fixes whether the power set can change, and the reasoning
// cites it protectively ("the issuer can never add confiscation later") as well
// as as an aggravator. Asserting the lock on a disagreement would hand the
// reader a reassurance one source contradicts, so the lock is claimed only when
// both copies agree it is set. On disagreement the report keeps the cautious
// reading: the flags may still change.
//
// Verified live on 2026-09-25 against six assets spanning the severity range:
// both endpoints carry identical field names and agreed in every case. This
// path is therefore expected to be cold, which is why a disagreement is
