// Package mechanics classifies trap risk for a Stellar asset from the
// ledger's own rules.
//
// The design rule here is that checks perform no I/O. Everything a check needs
// is fetched once, up front, into a Subject; a check is then a pure function
// from Subject to Finding. That keeps checks deterministic, makes them testable
// from fixtures with no network, and confines every fetcher to its own package
// where it can be extracted later.
