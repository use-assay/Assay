// produces is attributed Evidence naming StellarExpert and the URL the claim
// came from.
//
// It is the only check permitted to escalate, and it can only ever raise the
// level. A confirmed malicious listing is decisive evidence of abuse. Absence
// from the list is not evidence of anything: most legitimate assets are absent,
// and so is every scam that has not been reported yet.
