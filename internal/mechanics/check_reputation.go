// AdverseDirectoryTags is the set of StellarExpert directory tags that
// escalate severity to critical. A listing carrying any of them is an
// affirmative adverse determination about the issuer, so it raises the level.
//
// It is a named, explicit set rather than an inline literal so the vocabulary
// is a reviewed artifact. A tag outside this set is never silently ignored:
// run records unrecognised tags as attributed evidence, which is what turns a
// newly introduced adverse tag into something visible rather than a false
// negative that never announces itself.
//
// Source and capture date. The vocabulary is StellarExpert's own published
// list, read on 2026-09-27 from both:
//   - GET https://api.stellar.expert/explorer/directory/tags (the API's "All
//     Directory tags" response), and
//   - github.com/stellar-expert/public-directory, "Standard account tags".
//
// Of those tags only two have a description asserting abuse or danger —
// "malicious" ("Account involved in theft/scam/spam/phishing") and "unsafe"
// ("Obsolete or potentially dangerous account"). Every other tag classifies
// what the account is (exchange, anchor, issuer, wallet, custodian, personal,
// sdf, memo-required, airdrop, obsolete-inflation-pool) without asserting it is
// malicious, so those stay non-escalating. See docs/checks.md.

// descriptiveDirectoryTags is the remainder of StellarExpert's published
// directory vocabulary: tags that describe what an account is without
// asserting it is dangerous. They are listed explicitly so an unrecognised tag
// can be told apart from a known-descriptive one: a known-descriptive tag is
// expected and needs no report, while an unrecognised tag is surfaced as
// evidence. Same source and capture date as AdverseDirectoryTags.
//
// "obsolete-inflation-pool" appears in the maintainers' repository list; the
// API response sample omits it, so it is kept here as part of the vocabulary.
