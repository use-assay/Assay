// Package temporal compares two observations of the same asset to answer what
// changed between them.
//
// Every check in internal/mechanics answers a prospective question: what can
// this issuer do to a trustline opened now. That is the right question for
// someone deciding whether to open one, and it is exactly what current issuer
// flags answer. It is the wrong question for a holder who already holds the
// asset and wants to know what moved since they last looked.
//
// Nothing here re-derives a verdict. An Observation carries the bitset and the
// severity a mechanics.Report already produced; this package only subtracts one
// observation from another. The comparison is a pure function over two
// observations — no storage, no I/O, no network. Where observations come from
// is a separate decision, written down in docs/transitions.md.
//
// Two distinctions are load-bearing, and the types enforce them rather than
// leaving them to prose:
//
//   - An empty difference is not the same as no answer. A comparison that was
//     made and found nothing returns State Valid with an empty bitset; a
//     comparison that could not be made returns State Unknown or Missing. A
//     consumer that reads only the bitset would collapse the two, so a caller
//     has to read State.
//   - A single observation yields no transition. That is State Missing, and it
//     is not "no change": there was never a second point to compare against.
//
// The representation was reviewed against internal/mechanics/mechanics.go. Every
// field of Observation is a copy of a field that file already defines on Report
// or Subject; no new severity semantics are introduced here. See
// docs/transitions.md for the mapping and the reasoning.
